Below will be the known bugs that are still within the game.

In general:
There is still a lot of code and accessories that are not used and should be deleted.
(Ex: upgrade abilities, regen, unneeded image folders)

In Waves Mode:
Boss 2 (Jimmy Kimmel) does not always stay on screen.
The NRA logo pick up does not have a sound associated with it.

In Coop Mode:
Pickups affect both players, not just the one that hits it.
Levels do not restart after someone wins or loses and the players go back to the menu screen to play again.

In Attack Mode:
If the player is moving with WSAD and is using a laptop mouse, they will not be able to move and aim their shot at the same time. If the player is using
WSAD to move and a mobile mouse to shoot, or the arrow keys to move, the issue is not present. 

In Defense Mode:
The algorithm for the enemies following the player or the server needs to be improved.  Even when the enemy is closer to the server it will have a tendency to move with the
key inputs of the player (same direction).
This game mode also does not have a formal way to win.
